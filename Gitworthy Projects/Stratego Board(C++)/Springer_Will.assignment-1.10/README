WELCOME TO STRATEGO (board setter upper...)
This program is a digital version of the board game stratego. It's in development, but here
are the current features:

-Creates a digital 10x10 board to play on
-Contains 40 pieces for each player, from generals to spies
-Two players can take turns setting up their sides of the board
-Move a cursor with "wasd" and use 'q' to quit

Here are things I'd like to implement, if I can get the time:

-Moving the pieces
-Interactions between pieces
-Win/lose state
